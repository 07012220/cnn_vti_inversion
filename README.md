Determination of the elastic parameters of a VTI medium from sonic logging data using deep learning

When a software component is an essential part of the paper presentation, authors should be prepared to make it available to reviewers during the review process. Software/scripts used or developed for the substantial part of the presented work must be open-source and freely available for download from a stable public repository (git repositories are encouraged). Please avoid i) inserting the code source directly in the manuscript, and ii) personal file-sharing services. The repository link should be included in the "Computer Code Availability" section, the download should be anonymous. Free open-source code for proprietary platforms (e.g. matlab or GIS plugins) are accepted and must be shared in the public repository.

Computer code should provide the following information:

1. A readme.txt file (or equivalent) providing the name of the program, the title of the manuscript along with the author details. This will assist in correctly assigning the program code and associated files to the correct submission.
2. A user manual or instruction guide that provides information on how to use the program.
3. The source code for any programs that have been written.
4. Test data that can be used to assure that the program is working correctly. Test data should not be overly large so that there are problems downloading the program code and data.
5. Output files should also be provided that will allow a user to check if a compiled program is working properly.
6. Executable program code is not encouraged because of difficulty in transmitting .exe files past Virus scanners and the limited life of executable code.
7. All files should be compressed into .zip or .gz format, which will then be placed on the Computers& Geosciences FTP site for download once the manuscript has been accepted and published.
